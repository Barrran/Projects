            <h1>About Me...</h1>
            <p>From my early days with a computer, I can remember learning the command line.  That little adventure spiraled out of control and has led me down a path of
                never-ending education.  Always trying to learn more about computers and better myself.  Unfortunately, I have not put as much effort into learn as I use to.
                This is the beginning of my climb back into the computer world, learning to become a..... COMPUTER PROGRAMMER (yay!)
