            <h1>Hobbies</h1>
            <p>There are many wonderful things these days that can take up so much of our free time.  Sometimes finding what you like can seem like an impossible task.
                I have been fortunate enough, however, to have been able to explore numerous different aspects of our world and have found a few things I cannot do without.
                Here is a list of my favorite hobbies, in no particular order.
            </p>
            <ul id="hobbies">
                <li>AI Generated Art</li>
                <li>Auto racing</li>
                <li>Video Games</li>
                <li>Horticulture</li>
                <li>Culinary Arts</li>
            </ul>

            <section id="hobbyList">
                <h2>AI Generated Art</h2>
                <p>AI Generated art has won me over!  I love the freedom and creativity that AI opens.  There are so many different rabbit holes to follow when it comes to 
                    AI assisted art.
                </p>
                
                <h2>Auto Racing</h2>
                <p>I've always had a love for cars.  Getting behind the wheel or watching them take corners, the thrill of auto racing makes my blood pump.  Beauty and technology
                    in one fluid concept.
                </p>

                <h2>Video Games</h2>
                <p>Since the early days of NES (the original Nintendo Entertainment System) I've been hooked.  There is something about video games that transforms life
                    into an extrodinary adventure.
                </p>

                <h2>Horticulture</h2>
                <p>Everything about plants makes me wonder.  How do they grow? How do they adapt?  How can I learn more?  This has been a life long passion that has helped 
                    shape my life throught learning about nutrition.
                </p>
                
                <h2>Culinary Arts</h2>
                <p>This goes hand-in-hand with Horticulture.  I grow the food, then I cook the food, then I eat the food.  I do try to cook the food in a really appetizing way.</p>
